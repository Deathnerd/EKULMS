\#\-E\-K\-U\-L\-M\-S

\subsection*{Readme}

The goal of this project is to create a Learning Management System suited for the specific needs of Eastern Kentucky University, specifically (for now) the Computer Science department. This is part of an undergraduate research project into the current state of Learning Management Systems and how they can be better improved to support student learning.

As of April 8th, 2014, E\-K\-U\-L\-M\-S is in alpha stage. This is a proof of concept that focuses on basic functions for creating tests and courses, and allowing users to track their progress. After April 28th, 2014, E\-K\-U\-L\-M\-S will undergo a major overhaul in code quality and usability.

\subsubsection*{Features to be completed at launch (Beginning of Fall 2014 semester)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Basic user account management -\/ {\bfseries Complete}
\item Basic course management -\/ {\bfseries Complete}
\item Basic test management -\/ {\bfseries In progress}
\item Integration with the E\-K\-U Central Authentication System -\/ {\bfseries Todo}
\item My\-S\-Q\-L P\-D\-O queries instead of inline P\-H\-P -\/ {\bfseries Todo}
\item User statistics with visual graphs representing a student's progress over time -\/ {\bfseries In progress}
\item Aesthetically pleasing, functional, and user-\/friendly U\-I -\/ {\bfseries Todo}
\item Complete A\-J\-A\-X/\-J\-S\-O\-N based R\-E\-S\-T A\-P\-I -\/ Indefinitely in progress$\ast$$\ast$
\item Full P\-H\-P\-Doc documentation for ease of future development -\/ {\bfseries Indefinitely in progress}
\item Complete code refactor to provide clean, maintainable code -\/ {\bfseries Todo}
\item Setup and migration scripts (Python or P\-H\-P) -\/ {\bfseries Todo (not necessary for launch)}
\item Full H\-T\-M\-L5 web standards compliance -\/ {\bfseries Indefinitely in progress}
\item Full responsive design -\/ {\bfseries Todo (not necessary for launch)}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Possible features to be implemented in the future}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Short video tutorials per test
\item Tutorials with autocomplete search and smart suggestions (this is very unlikely in the near future)
\item Questions where the user will have to code and said code will be evaluated for correctness
\item Anything else that is requested, within reason
\end{DoxyItemize}

Again, this is currently in very rough, incomplete Alpha stage and is not completely indicative of what will be available at launch
