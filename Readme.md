#EKULMS

##Readme

The goal of this project is to create a Learning Management System suited for the specific needs of Eastern Kentucky University, specifically (for now) the Computer Science department. This is part of an undergraduate research project into the current state of Learning Management Systems and how they can be better improved to support student learning.

As of April 8th, 2014, EKULMS is in alpha stage. This is a proof of concept that focuses on basic functions for creating tests and courses, and allowing users to track their progress. After April 28th, 2014, EKULMS will undergo a major overhaul in code quality and usability. 

###Features to be completed at launch (Beginning of Fall 2014 semester)

* Basic user account management - **Complete**
* Basic course management - **Complete**
* Basic test management - **Complete**
* User statistics with visual graphs representing a student's progress over time - **In progress**
* Aesthetically pleasing, functional, and user-friendly UI - **Todo**
* Complete AJAX/JSON based REST API - **Indefinitely in progress**
* Full PHPDoc documentation for ease of future development - **Indefinitely in progress**
* Complete code refactor to provide clean, maintainable code - **Complete**
* Setup and migration scripts (Python or PHP) - **Todo (not necessary for launch)**
* Full HTML5 web standards compliance - **Indefinitely in progress**


###Possible features to be implemented in the future

* Short video tutorials per test
* MySQL PDO queries instead of inline PHP
* Integration with the EKU Central Authentication System
* Tutorials with autocomplete search and smart suggestions (this is very unlikely in the near future)
* Questions where the user will have to code and said code will be evaluated for correctness
* Full responsive design
* Anything else that is requested, within reason

Again, this is currently in very rough, incomplete Alpha stage and is not completely indicative of what will be available at launch
